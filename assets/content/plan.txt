Plan the website's structure and content. This includes deciding on the main pages, such as the homepage, services page, and contact page, as well as what information will be included on each page.

Design the website's layout and choose a color scheme. This step involves creating a visual representation of the website and determining how the different pages and elements will be arranged.

Develop the website using web development tools and languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is the process of actually creating the website and making it functional.

Test the website to ensure that it works correctly and is compatible with different web browsers.

Launch the website and make it live for the world to see.

Make sure to continually update the website and improve it over time to keep it current and engaging for visitors.

In terms of technical aspect you may use website builder or CMS software like wordpress, Joomla, Magento, Shopify and etc. or have a professional developer build it from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some back-end programming languages such as PHP, Python or Ruby.
